# SENG437

I recently added the JFreeChart_Lab3 folder. If you clone the repositry and set your project workspace 
to the SENG437 folder that is created then create a java project called JFreeChart_Lab3 all the files for
the project should be loaded into the project automaticly. The tests we wrote for the last milestone are in
the src/org/jfree/data/test package in the src folder.
